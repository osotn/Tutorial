PlayStation 4 joypads
=====================
Those devices use “cable-pairing” as well. Plug the joypads in via USB with the Bluetooth Settings opened, and Bluetooth turned on. You will get asked whether to set those joypads up without needing to press the PS button. Unplug them and press the PS button to use them over Bluetooth.

Using the “PS” and “Share” button combination to pair the joypad can also be used to make the joypad visible and pair it like any other Bluetooth device, if you don’t have a USB cable at hand.
