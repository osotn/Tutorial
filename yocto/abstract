Yocto project build system overview

Poky = BitBake + metadata

Poky - build system used by the Yocto Project
BitBake - a task executor and scheduler
Metadata - task definitions
	- Configuration (.conf) - global definition of variables;
	- Classes (.bbclass) - encapsulation and inheritance of build logic, packaging, etc.
	- Recipes (.bb) - the logic units of software/images to build.

A recipe is a set of instructions for building packages, including:
	- Where to obtain the upstream sources and which patches to apply;
	- Dependencies (on libraries or other recipes)
	- Configuration/compilation options
	- Define what files go into what output packages
